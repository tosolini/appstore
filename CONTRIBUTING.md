# Contributing to Appstore

We welcome contributions to improve the appstore project! Whether it's bug fixes, new features, documentation, or other enhancements, your help makes this project better.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally: `git clone https://github.com/tosolini/appstore.git`.
3. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`.
4. Make your changes and commit them: `git commit -m "Add your descriptive message"`.
5. Push to your branch: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`.
6. Submit a pull request (PR) from your fork to the main repository.

## Development Setup

- Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed (given your setup with Ubuntu Server and Portainer).
- Review the README for any specific build/run instructions.
- Test changes locally using `docker-compose up` or equivalent commands.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- **Link issues**: Reference related issues in your PR description (e.g., "Fixes #123").
- **Describe changes**: Explain what the PR does, why it's needed, and any breaking changes.
- **Small commits**: Keep commits atomic and focused—one feature or fix per commit.
- **Branch naming**: Use descriptive names like `fix/docker-issue` or `feat/new-endpoint`.

## Code Standards

- Follow existing code style (Python, Docker configs, etc.).
- Write clear commit messages in imperative mood (e.g., "Add user authentication").
- Add or update tests for new features or bug fixes.
- Update documentation if your changes affect usage.

## Reporting Bugs

- Check existing issues first.
- Provide steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, and environment details (OS, Docker version, etc.).
- Use the issue template if available.

## Feature Requests

- Open an issue describing the feature, use case, and why it benefits the project.
- Discuss implementation details before starting work.
